# FindBlock
Gives x/y/z coordinates for a specific block type in a region selected via WorldEdit

- Built against Worldedit v6.1 (latest) *[Requires the WorldEdit plugin to be in your plugins folder]*
- ~~Some blocks aren't currently found and may throw errors. This is a known issue and is being looked into.~~ All blocks are currently supported via deprecated ```getId()```. It will be left this way until the transition to block names is complete.
